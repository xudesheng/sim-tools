# sim-tools
I've been creating various tools for scale testing over the years. Each tool was made for a specific purpose, making them difficult to share.

These tools were developed quickly as needed, without a detailed plan or goal. They were made efficiently, but the quality is not high enough to share proudly. The code is disorganized and lacks documentation.

I'm unsure if I should make the code open source for several reasons. Meanwhile, more colleagues are asking to use these tools. Previously, I let them access my private repository, but this method isn't efficient.

To address this, I'm actively working to make the tools available publicly. My colleagues can then download them as needed. My current focus is on two areas: updating the old code for the latest products and adding some basic documentation.

Please note, using these tools is at your own risk and responsibility. You must ensure privacy and security. Feel free to report issues or make requests. I'll help when I can, but as I work on this in my free time, my availability is limited.

The four main tools I'm preparing to share are:

1. **Batch-tester:** This tool helps you set up various test configurations using different edge simulation tools.
2. **Sim-thing:** A tool that simulates the 'AlwaysOn' protocol.
3. **Sim-kepware:** This tool is designed to simulate the Kepware product.
4. **Sim-mqtt:** A tool for simulating 'Thing' communications via the MQTT protocol.
